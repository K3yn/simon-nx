# Simon NX v0.2

A work in progress memory game.

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison,
 with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails the game is over.
Much of the assembly language was written by Charles Kapps. Simon was launched in 1978 at Studio 54 in New York City and was an immediate success,
becoming a pop culture symbol of the 1970s and 1980s.
